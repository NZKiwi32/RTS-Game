# Game
This project aims to build a game shippable to android/html/desktop using the libraries:
LibGDX - Multiplatform Game Framework
Ashley - Component Entity System

Initially this project will port the components and systems from the other Ashley project for reuse (eventually split into there own repo). From this repo:
