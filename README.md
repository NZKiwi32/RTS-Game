# Game
This project aims to build a game shippable to android/html/desktop using the libraries:
* LibGDX - Multiplatform Game Framework
* Ashley - Component Entity System

Initially this project will port the components and systems from the other Ashley project for reuse (eventually split into there own repo). From this repo:
* https://github.com/NZKiwi32/BasicAndroidGame
